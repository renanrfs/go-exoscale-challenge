# Usage Billing System

This is a simple Go repository witch three challenges:

1. `billing-statement.go`: simple billing system which feeds off a list of usage records.
2. `job-position.go`: mock JSON HTTP API for a minimalist job board application.
   1. `job-posting.postman_collection.json`: Postman collection for the API.
3. `asn1-parsing.go`: ASN.1 parser that is sufficient to handle private keys in the EC and RSA format

## Usage

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program using:
   1. `go run billing-statement.go`.
   2. `go run job-posting.go`.
   3. `go run asn1-parsing.go`.
